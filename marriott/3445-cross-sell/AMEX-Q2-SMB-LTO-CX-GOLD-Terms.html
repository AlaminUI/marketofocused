Eligible purchases to meet the Threshold Amount can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account.

        Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional Points. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional Points if the merchant’s code is not included in a reward category. You may not receive additional Points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, you may not receive additional Points when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or you choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet. For questions about additional Points on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. For more details on eligible purchases and exclusions, please visit <a href="[@trackurl LinkID='' LinkName='XS_GOLD_Terms Link 8' LinkTag='1000689604' Tracked='ON' Encode='OFF' LinkType='REDIRECT']http://americanexpress.com/rewards-info?nck=${Profile.CustomerKey}&ck=${CAMPAIGN_KEY}&lk=1000689604[/@trackurl]" target="_blank"  style="color:#1c1c1c; text-decoration:underline;">americanexpress.com/rewards-info</a>.
