     You can earn 95,000 Marriott Bonvoy bonus points after you complete $6,000 or more (the “Threshold Amount”) in eligible purchases on your Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant<sup style="font-size:8px;line-height:10px;vertical-align: 3px;">®</sup> American Express<sup style="font-size:8px;line-height:10px;vertical-align: 3px;">®</sup> Card within your first 6 months of Card Membership, starting from the date your account is opened. In rare instances, your period to spend $6,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6-month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped.) Eligible purchases to meet the Threshold Amount can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person- to-person payments, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for this offer. Bonus points will appear on your Marriott Bonvoy Member Account 8–12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus points may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To earn the bonus points, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. If you have a history of cancelling or downgrading American Express Card accounts within your first year and you cancel or downgrade your new Card account within your first year, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the Marriott Bonvoy points from your account. If we determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this offer in any way or that you intend to do so, including if you return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount, we may not credit, we may freeze, or we may take away the Marriott Bonvoy points from your account. We may also cancel any accounts you have with us. This offer is not transferable. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time.

        Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional points.
