Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). Eligible purchases to meet the Threshold Amount can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for this offer. Bonus points will appear on your Marriott Bonvoy member account 8–12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus points may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To earn the bonus points, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.

      Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible for additional Points. A purchase with a merchant will not receive additional Points if the merchant’s code is not included in a reward category. You may not receive additional Points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for a reward category. For example, you may not receive additional Points when: a merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or a merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or you choose to make a purchase using a third-party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.
