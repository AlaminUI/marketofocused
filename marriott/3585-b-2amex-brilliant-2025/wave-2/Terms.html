In rare instances, your period to spend $6,000 may be shorter than 6 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 6-month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). Eligible purchases to meet the Threshold Amount can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for this offer. Bonus points will appear on your Marriott Bonvoy member account 8–12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. The $250 statement credit will be posted to your Card account within 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Bonus points and the statement credit may appear on your account in more than one deposit. To earn the 150,000 bonus points and $250 statement credit, your Card account must not be cancelled or past due at the time of fulfillment.

Purchases by both the Basic Card Member and Additional Card Members on an eligible Card Account are eligible for statement credits. Each Card Account is eligible for up to $25 in statement credits per month, for a total of up to $300 per calendar year in statement credits across all Cards on the Account. The Dining Credit benefit is not valid for the purchase of gift cards or merchandise, or for purchases at non-restaurant merchants including nightclubs, convenience stores, grocery stores, or supermarkets. American Express relies on the merchant to process transactions within the same calendar month that you made the purchase in order to apply the statement credit in the month that it was intended. For example, if you make an eligible purchase on the last day of the month and the merchant doesn't process that transaction until the next day, the transaction date will reflect the next day's date and the statement credit would be applied in the following month. Purchases posted after 120 days from the transaction date will not be considered for a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible for this benefit, you will not receive the statement credit. For example, your transaction will not be eligible if it is not made directly with the merchant. You may not receive the statement credit if the transaction was made at a restaurant located within another establishment (e.g., a restaurant inside a hotel, casino, or event venue) if that transaction is not recognized as a purchase at a restaurant. In addition, in most cases, you may not receive the statement credit if your transaction is made with an electronic wallet, through a third party, or if the merchant uses a mobile or wireless card reader to process it. Please allow 8 -12 weeks after an eligible purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to your Account. To be eligible for this benefit, your Card Account must not be canceled or past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. For additional information, call the number on the back of your Card.

      This benefit is not exclusive to Cards offered by American Express. You can receive only the Annual ENC benefit associated with one eligible Marriott Bonvoy consumer card per year, regardless of the number of Marriott Bonvoy cards that are linked with a Marriott Bonvoy Member Account and regardless of bank issuer. If your Marriott Bonvoy Member Account is linked to more than one open Marriott Bonvoy consumer card that offers the Annual ENC benefit, you will receive only the Annual ENC benefit associated with the card that offers the highest number of ENCs. If you have both an open Marriott Bonvoy consumer card account and an open Marriott Bonvoy business card account that each offer the Annual ENC benefit, then you will receive an Annual ENC benefit for each, for a total of two Annual ENC benefits per Marriott Bonvoy Member Account per year. If you have more than one Marriott Bonvoy Member Account that has received the Annual ENC benefit and you merge accounts, you will retain only the ENCs associated with one eligible Marriott Bonvoy consumer card that offers the highest number of ENCs as a benefit; and, if applicable, the ENCs from one eligible Marriott Bonvoy business card that offers the highest number of ENCs as a benefit.
