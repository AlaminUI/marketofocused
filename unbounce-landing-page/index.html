<a href="#acccordian1" class="accordion-toggle active">How is Inspire different from my current utility company?</a>
<div class="accordion-content active" id="acccordian1">
 <p>Many power companies connect you with energy sourced from fossil fuels, like natural gas and coal, that have to be burned to generate energy. But the burning of these fossil fuels adds harmful emissions into the atmosphere, which contributes to the effects of climate change. 
</p>
<p>When you choose Inspire Clean Energy, we match your energy usage with renewable energy sources like wind and solar, so you can rest easy knowing you’re helping avoid carbon emissions and getting closer to achieving a net-zero carbon home. 
</p>
<p>When you sign up for one of our retail electricity supply plans provided by Inspire Energy Holdings, LLC, Inspire becomes your electricity supplier. You’ll still pay your utility company directly as usual — the only difference is that you’ll see Inspire listed as your electricity supplier under the “supply” or “generation” section of your bill. This section is often listed after your distribution charges, which your utility still controls. If you have trouble finding Inspire on your next utility bill or have questions about how billing works on your specific plan, feel free to reach out to us, and we’ll be happy to walk you through it!
</p>
<p>In all cases, your local utility company will still be responsible for delivering energy to your home and handling any service interruptions.</p>

<div class="single-accordian">
<a href="#acccordian5" class="accordion-toggle"> How does your clean energy plan work? </a>
<div class="accordion-content" id="acccordian5">
   <p>By connecting to the local energy grid, the electricity you receive comes from a mix of energy sources. You will not receive electricity from any specific generation facility delivered directly to your service address, however Inspire ensures that 100% of your electricity consumption is sourced from clean energy generation facilities or otherwise paired with renewable Energy Certificates (“RECs”) from generation facilities located in the U.S By purchasing RECs to match your electricity usage and retiring them in a generation attribute tracking systems, we enable you to directly support the continued use and development of clean electricity. Increased demand for, and generation of, clean electricity helps reduce carbon emissions and provides other local and global environmental benefits in the region where the clean electricity generator is located. Environmental disclosures can be found at www.inspirecleanenergy.com.</p>
